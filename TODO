0) Labelize data

1) Compute all trajectories derivatives (speed, sinuosity, etc. (see characteristic list)) -> YELU
- Summarize it per segments (Doing moving window for every derivative?)

2) Annotate trajectories with proximity to environment datasets (TP network, topography) -> MARTINE
Per segment (% of points in the proximity)
does it intersect to [] TRUE/FALSE:
- highway (10m)
- railways - train (10m)
- railways - trams (10m)
- bus stops (buffer 5m)
- lake (inside: 1m)
- mountain area (inside)

3) Summarize characteristics per mean of transport

4) Machine Learning
...

Characteristics list:
  segment_id
  length
  time (time duration of one segment)
  speed:
    horizontal speed: mean, std, range
    vertical speed: mean, std, range
  sinuosity: mean, std, range(difference between biggest and smallest)
  acceleration: mean, std, range
  slope: mean, std, range
