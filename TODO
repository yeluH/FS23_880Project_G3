TODO 3
-------
0) Labelize data (Martine)
1) Summarize characteristics per mean of transport (Yelu)
   Use value instead of boolean for annotation result
   - Statistics for methodology part
   - Boxplot for result part
   Optimize the boxplot
2) Machine Learning
   Change parameter sets (Yelu)
   Visualization
3) Paperwork (Martine & Yelu)


TODO 2
-------
0) Labelize data (Martine)
1) Finish computing all trajectories derivatives (speed, sinuosity, etc. (see characteristic list)) (Yelu)
   More attributes  
   Try to avoid NA
2) Annotate trajectories with proximity to environment datasets (TP network, topography) (Martine)
   Change for Plane
3) Summarize characteristics per mean of transport (Yelu)
4) Machine Learning (:D :D :D Wunderbar)
   Change parameter sets? for better performance (Yelu)
   Visualize? with comparing test_pred/train_pred and true label (Martine)
5) Paperwork (Martine & Yelu)
6) Try knitting/rendering and update index.html (Yelu)


TODO 1
-------
0) Labelize data

1) Compute all trajectories derivatives (speed, sinuosity, etc. (see characteristic list)) -> YELU
- Summarize it per segments (Doing moving window for every derivative?)

2) Annotate trajectories with proximity to environment datasets (TP network, topography) -> MARTINE
Per segment (% of points in the proximity)
does it intersect to [] TRUE/FALSE:
- highway (10m)
- railways - train (10m)
- railways - trams (10m)
- bus stops (buffer 5m)
- lake (inside: 1m)
- mountain area (inside)

3) Summarize characteristics per mean of transport

4) Machine Learning
...

Characteristics list:
  segment_id
  length
  time (time duration of one segment)
  speed:
    horizontal speed: mean, std, range
    vertical speed: mean, std, range
  sinuosity: mean, std, range(difference between biggest and smallest)
  acceleration: mean, std, range
  slope: mean, std, range
