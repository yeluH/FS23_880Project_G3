## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

Potential ideas:

- identify different patterns for week days and week-ends
- identify pattern for leisure time

1. Movement pattern for each travel mode: summary characteristics from our data and literature
- Travel mode to explore : train, tram, bus, car, walking, cycling, running, kick scooter, ski, ski-lift

- Pattern specific to each travel mode: trams and trains follow tracks, ski only happen in mountain and has specific slope.
- metrics: speed (acceleration, deceleration), sinuosity (angle, direction)

- data to use: 
- trajectories timestampt
- tram tracks
- roads
- slope

3. Can we use these characteristics to identify travel mode?



Preference based on weather, slope, availibility, distance, objective mind
