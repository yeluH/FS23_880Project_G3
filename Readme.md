## Abstract 
<!-- (50-60 words) -->

Potential ideas:

- identify different patterns for week days and week-ends
- identify pattern for leisure time

1. Movement pattern for each travel mode: summary characteristics from our data and literature
- Travel mode to explore : train, tram, bus, car, walking, cycling, running, kick scooter, ski, ski-lift

- Pattern specific to each travel mode: trams and trains follow tracks, ski only happen in mountain and has specific slope.
- metrics: speed (acceleration, deceleration), sinuosity (angle, direction)

- data to use: 
- trajectories timestampt
- tram tracks
- roads
- slope

3. Can we use these characteristics to identify travel mode?



Preference based on weather, slope, availibility, distance, objective mind




## Research Questions
1. Do the characteristics of movement trajectories differ bettween different travel modes?
2. Could the characteristics be used to identify travel mode?
3. How to identify different travel modes with movement trajectories? Could a identification model be built?
4. How accurate and efficient could different travel modes be identified based on the aforementioned identification model?




## Results / products
1. Characteristics summary of movement trajectories of different travel modes.
2. An identification model for travel mode based on movement tractory data.
3. Assessment of the identification model.


## Data
<!-- What data will you use? Will you require additional context data? Where do you get this data from? Do you already have all the data? -->
#### Data used 
1. Movement data collected with POSMO (mobile tracking app) and GPS trackers (external device).
2. (Option)Transport network(railway/street network, cycling/walking/skiing paths), tram/bus/train stops and stations, and tram/bus/train time schedules.
#### Data source
1. Volunteered movement data of two college students
2. Open data from SwissTopo
